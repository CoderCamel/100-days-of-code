# 100 Days Of Code - Log
YYYY-MM-DD format - because ISO8601 is where it's at!

### Day 10: 2021-06-09
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Experimented with CSS Grid, figuring out what works and what doesn't. Tried to break the grid in different ways and seeing what effects it had.

**Thoughts:** Read a great tip about how to vertically center something in a grid item without affecting div stretch size - just turn the grid item into a flexbox!

### Day 9: 2021-06-08
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my tribute page. 

**Thoughts:** Had a lot of issues regarding a div size, all caused by not realizing that <figure> is a block element, kept looking for the culprit elsewhere. All's well that ends well tho Smiling face with open mouth and smiling eyes

### Day 8: 2021-06-07
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about CSS Grid. Played through <a href="https://cssgridgarden.com/">Grid Garden</a> and <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox Froggy</a>.
Started building my FCC Tribute Page.

**Thoughts:** I'm having an issue where a `<div>` container expands to the width of the page instead of just wrapping around its child image. I've tried using `display: inline-block;` on both the image and the container but no cigar. Taking a fresh look at it tomorrow.

### Day 7: 2021-06-06
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Was only able to study for 1h30min today due to time constraints. Learned about responsive design tools, like media queries and viewport units. Read an article on the uses of vmin and vmax to solve the issue of text getting too large/small on landscape/portrait devices.

**Thoughts:** My first week of the challenge is done, and I'm very happy with my progress and consistency so far.

### Day 6: 2021-06-05
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Played through http://www.flexboxdefense.com/, after this and the codingfantasy site I feel very confident with CSS flexbox. Took the W3C HTML quiz over at https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp and filled in some knowledge gaps that the FCC course didn't cover (or didn't cover yet).

**Thoughts:** It's impressive how much easy pre-made stuff you can implement with just a simple HTML tag, like `<video controls>` or `<meter>`. I can imagine that implementing elements like this would have been quite a headache for developers 20 years ago.

### Day 5: 2021-06-04
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Today I've been experimenting with different CSS animation-timing-functions. Have also been learning about coding for accessibility and semantic meaning, for example the HTML landmark elements such as `<article>`, `<section>` etc.

**Thoughts:** After hearing an audio file of how fast screen readers read the information to their users, I still have a hard time understanding how people can parse meaningful information at that speed - I could barely make out any words at all. Impressive!

### Day 4: 2021-06-03
##### 

This is my first entry! Since I've been coding for 15 hours so far this week, I figured I might as well jump on board with this challenge. Why am I doing this? For motivation and accountability.

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished learning the CSS flexbox game over at https://codingfantasy.com/ - the format was very useful for learning, I'm really digging this gamification of learning. Have also been learning about CSS animations at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** CSS is amazing, it's so simple and yet powerful.
