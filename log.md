# 100 Days Of Code - Log
YYYY-MM-DD format - because ISO8601 is where it's at!

### Day 6: 2021-06-05

**Today's Progress**: Played through http://www.flexboxdefense.com/, after this and the codingfantasy site I feel very confident with CSS flexbox. Took the W3C HTML quiz over at https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quiz.asp and filled in some knowledge gaps that the FCC course didn't cover (or didn't cover yet).

**Thoughts:** It's impressive how much easy pre-made stuff you can implement with just a simple HTML tag, like <video controls> or <meter>. I can imagine that implementing elements like this would have been quite a headache for developers 20 years ago.

**Today's Progress**: Today I've been experimenting with different CSS animation-timing-functions. Have also been learning about coding for accessibility and semantic meaning, for example the HTML landmark elements such as `<article>`, `<section>` etc.

**Thoughts:** After hearing an audio file of how fast screen readers read the information to their users, I still have a hard time understanding how people can parse meaningful information at that speed - I could barely make out any words at all. Impressive!

### Day 4: 2021-06-03
##### 

This is my first entry! Since I've been coding for 15 hours so far this week, I figured I might as well jump on board with this challenge. Why am I doing this? For motivation and accountability.

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished learning the CSS flexbox game over at https://codingfantasy.com/ - the format was very useful for learning, I'm really digging this gamification of learning. Have also been learning about CSS animations at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** CSS is amazing, it's so simple and yet powerful.
