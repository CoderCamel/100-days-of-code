This is my first entry! Since I've been coding for 15 hours so far this week, I figured I might as well jump on board with this challenge. Why am I doing this? For motivation and accountability.

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished learning the CSS flexbox game over at https://codingfantasy.com/ - the format was very useful for learning, I'm really digging this gamification of learning. Have also been learning about CSS animations at FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** CSS is amazing, it's so simple and yet powerful.
